### 910x Turning Point World's Robot

This robot was the culmination of my teammate and I's development during the VRC Turning Point season. The objective of the game was to build a robot capable of targetting flags, manipulating caps, and navigating field obstacles. We created a platform featuring a single flywheel paired with a roller and scraper combo to accomplish these objectives efficiently.

Each match consisted of two periods: an autonomous period, during which each team executed pre-programmed instructions to score as many points as possible, and a driver control period. 

To maximize our robot's performance during the autonomous period, we implemented an s-curve motion profile for the drive, a PID controller for the scraper, and a modified I-controller called [TBH](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/software/control-algorithms/take-back-half-tbh-controller) for the flywheel. Our implementations along with the rest of the necessary source code can be found in [this GitHub repository.](https://github.com/alessandrolandi/910x-vrc-tp-worlds)

Over the course of the season, we won 4 out of 5 of the regional tournamenst we attended, won the Florida State Championship, and were Division Finalists at World's.
